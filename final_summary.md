**Introduction to PE-GPT and its Significance**

The introduction of PE-GPT, a novel multimodal large language model, marks a significant advancement in the field of power electronics (PE) design. Specifically designed to overcome the limitations of general large language models (LLMs), PE-GPT incorporates a PE knowledge base, integrates with metaheuristic algorithms, and utilizes a Model Zoo and Simulation Repository. This innovative framework enables PE-GPT to process both textual and quantitative data, facilitating design optimization, simulation verification, and fine-tuning of data-driven models. Evaluations through case studies and hardware experiments demonstrate PE-GPT's superior correctness, consistency, and design optimization capabilities compared to both human experts and other LLMs.

**Technical Overview of PE-GPT**

PE-GPT leverages a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) technique to address domain expertise limitations, allowing it to handle both textual queries and PE-specific fine-tuning data like waveforms. The authors explore three customization techniques for LLMs: chain-of-thoughts prompting, RAG, and fine-tuning, ultimately proposing a tailored approach combining prompt engineering and RAG due to their flexibility and simplicity. PE-GPT is designed to be adaptable to various power converters, with a focus on the DAB converter. This research demonstrates the potential of LLMs for intelligent PE design and explores future directions and ethical considerations. The framework's flexibility is further enhanced by a RAG system, allowing for customizable knowledge bases tailored to specific applications.

**Applications and Case Studies**

The effectiveness of PE-GPT is demonstrated through various case studies, showcasing its potential to revolutionize PE design by enhancing efficiency and accuracy. For instance, PE-GPT successfully designs circuits, such as an output LC filter for a buck converter, meeting desired specifications for voltage and current ripple while considering power density. PE-GPT's performance is validated through comparison with PLECS simulations and human expert designs, achieving accurate ripple predictions. Furthermore, PE-GPT outperforms both human experts and state-of-the-art LLMs in understanding and responding to PE-related queries, showcasing its effectiveness in comprehending complex PE concepts.

**Advancements in Power Electronics**

In addition to PE-GPT, the research explores advancements in power electronics, including the development of a 5-degree-of-freedom (5DoF) modulation strategy for power converters. This strategy achieves both zero-voltage switching (ZVS) and zero-current switching (ZCS) across various load conditions, outperforming existing methods in terms of efficiency, current stress, and soft switching capabilities. The 5DoF strategy is particularly effective at light loads, making it a promising solution for power electronic systems. These findings highlight the potential of AI-powered solutions like PE-GPT for optimizing power electronic designs and the effectiveness of advanced control strategies for achieving efficient and reliable power conversion.

**Ethical Considerations and Responsible Implementation**

While PE-GPT and other AI-powered solutions offer significant benefits, the authors emphasize the crucial need to address ethical considerations such as data privacy, security, and potential bias in training data. Mitigating these risks through robust security measures, diverse datasets, fairness-aware algorithms, and transparent decision-making processes is essential for responsible implementation. The research highlights the importance of careful consideration for the beneficial use of AI in power electronics, ensuring that these technologies are developed and deployed in a responsible and ethical manner.

**Intersection of AI and Power Electronics**

The research explores the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI) and power electronics, particularly in the design of dual active bridge DC-DC converters. AI-driven modulation strategies for improved efficiency and zero-voltage switching are investigated, with physics-informed AI models like PE-GPT showing promise for interactive and efficient design.
